## Features

- Alert when Pocket slot is Inactive while in combat
- Alert when Pocket slot is Active while out of combat

\* You are considered "in combat" if you have an active target. You are considered "out of combat" if you do not have an active target.

If you encounter any other bugs - please submit an issue and I'll investigate it.

## Upcoming Features

- Adjustable font size for the overlay
- Adjustable font color for the overlay

## Known Issues

- Grimoire/God Book/Scrimshaw messaging is only updated when a chat message is detected. If you have an active grimoire and swap to a god book when you lose your target it will say your grimoire is active while out of combat. I won't be fixing this.
