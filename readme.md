# What's In Your Pocket?

Uses chat active/no longer active messaging to alert you when you leave your Pocket Slot enabled when out of combat... or when you forget to active it while in combat!

## How to Install & Required Settings

To install Better Buff Bar copy & paste this link into Alt1's browser app:
`alt1://addapp/https://nadyanayme.github.io/WhatsInYourPocket/dist/appconfig.json`

If you do not have Alt1 Toolkit installed already you can [download it from runeapps.org](https://runeapps.org/alt1). In order for What's In Your Pocket? to work make sure your Runescape settings for Game and UI Scale settings are set to `100%` as this is required for Alt1 to be able to read your game screen. Your game chat must also be visible at all times as it is used to read the "active/no longer active" messages to track the status of your pocket item.

## Features

\* You are considered "in combat" if you have an active target. You are considered "out of combat" if you do not have an active target.

If you encounter any other bugs - please submit an issue and I'll investigate it.

## Known Issues

- Grimoire/God Book/Scrimshaw messaging is only updated when a chat message is detected. If you have an active grimoire and swap to a god book when you lose your target it will say your grimoire is active while out of combat. I won't be fixing this.
